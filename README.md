# food-point-finder
Web app for Duke students to find dinner conversations, written in Django 

Food Point Finder helps Duke students interact in a mutually beneficial exchange of conversation and hearty food. 
A user enters their interests, and the app will match you to someone- surplus food points will go to good use, and friendships will 
be formed.
